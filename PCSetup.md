#PC Setup

These are pre-requisite steps. You may already have some of this software on your machine, but this is a chance to double check you have what you need..

##1. Install Visual Studio Code
These labs will use **Visual Studio Code** as the development environment for building and updating the sample web application. You can use any web text editor such as Sublime, WebStorm etc if you wish, but the instructions are written based on Visual Studio Code.

You can download **Visual Studio Code** for Windows, Linux and OSX from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

##2. Install Google Chrome
The lab will make use of a Google Chrome Extension (Yahoo YSlow), so you must have Google Chrome installed. You can download it [https://www.google.com/chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html)

##3. Install NodeJS
Node is required in order to run various packages required for the Performance lab. You can install Node for your platform from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).

##6. OPTIONAL: Get access to Windows 10 with Microsoft Edge
These labs work best if you have Microsoft Edge which is the default browser in Windows 10. If you are already using Windows 10, you are good to go.

Do not worry if you cannot get Windows 10, it is a 'nice to have' for this lab but not mandatory. If you would like to test Microsoft Edge out, there are a few options depending on what type of machine you are using:

1. You can download a Virtual Machine with Windows 10 and Edge for free from the [Microsoft Edge Dev portal](https://dev.modern.ie/tools/vms/windows/). All the main Virtual Machine and OS combinations are available (Windows, Mac and Linux).

1. You can create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Azure to access via remote desktop. Get started with a free trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/trial/free-trial-virtual-machines/)

1. If you have Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, you can probably upgrade to Windows 10 for free. Check your options [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-10-upgrade)
